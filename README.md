This project is a sound processing application that imports an audio file, finds the duration, 
the dominant frequency of the audio, and the low, mid, and high frequencies in addition to the entire frequency band.
It uses these values to plot a waveform graph, a low, mid, and high plot of the frequencies, and all frequencies.

This application currently supports .wav, .m4a, and .mp3 audio files.

Instructions:

-Click "Open an Audio File" to select an audio file, followed by open to open the chosen file

-The "Switch Freqency Band" button will iterate through the 3 graphs of the frequency bands.

-The "Combine All Frequency Plots" button will show the graph for the entire frequency band.
