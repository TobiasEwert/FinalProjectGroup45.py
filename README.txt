This project is a sound processing application that imports an audio, finds the duration, the low, mid, and high frequencies, and the dominant frequenciesof the audio. It uses these values to plot a waveform graph, and a low, mid, and a high plot of the frequencies.

You can use the application by clicking the input value button, clicking on the audio you want to use, and then use the button to switch through the frequencies of the three graphs.
